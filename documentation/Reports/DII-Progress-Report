State of the Project 10/9

Since the presentation, we have decided to build a web app instead of a C++ desktop
app. We will make use of HTML+CSS, Javascript, and PHP, and will use Atom text
editor. Changes to design include: hotel and restaurant price check, sidebar
navigation, optional account creation (with home city and favorites), and plan on
map data for traffic. Scratched gas prices from features for now. Have completed
all of deliverable II except the test cases and full documents, probably going to
use a slack day. The app itself has already been started and we currently have the 
main/search page mostly set up. We have the entire visual layout and navigation 
design concepts in mind.
