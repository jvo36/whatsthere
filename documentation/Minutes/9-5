Discussion: Resumed discussion of project ideas. Abandoned the shopping and music app ideas, and discussed our thoughts for a
tavel/city info app and a traffic light controller for emergency vehicles. This discussion lasted the entire meeting, and we
decided to keep thinking about which app would be best and decide next meeting.
