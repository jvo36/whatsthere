Discussion: Continued discussing the features, and began to discuss development environments.
Decided it would be best to do a desktop app rather than mobile. 

New features:
    - Search bar should be two dropdown menus, first select from supported states, then select
    supported city from the state.
    - This app doesn't need to be limited to travel, residents can use it as a central information
    hub where they can find their city info in one place.
    - Besides general geography of the area, we could include hiking locations etc.
    - Environment tips for travelers.
    
Development:
    - Plan to use Visual Studio with C++
