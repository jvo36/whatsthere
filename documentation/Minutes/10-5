In-class discussion: Review of class diagrams. Discussed the visual/user interface design. 
  Made preliminary visual design for the entire web app (implenting this has begun). 
  Decided that primary navigation will be with a side-bar on the left of the screen.
  Decided log-in should be optional, can use site as guest, having an account enables:
  home city, favorites.
  
Evening meeting

Activity: Created class diagram, all but the side-bar functionalities included so far.
  From this and our design decisions in class, we have a nearly exact idea how the
  program will function.
